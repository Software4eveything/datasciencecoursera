Make a unique dataframe of "DataSet" by using combination of columns "id" and "id_2"
Verify that for every (id, id_2) pair, there is only one entry in the DataFrame. If there are multiple entries for a given pair, keep the entry that has the largest value in the "Hov2" column. For example, if the pair (1210000, 1210002) has two entries, keep only the entry with the highest value for "Car" (i.e., 1.5). (Create a function)
Once the DataFrame has been modified accordingly, sort it using both the "id" and "id_2" columns.
Finally, convert the sorted DataFrame to a CSV file named "task_1.csv".
